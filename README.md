# Bringing Data to Life with Visualization
In this camp, students will discover the importance of data visualization. They will explore an interesting data set and figure out how to translate it into a satisfying visual. The goal is to learn how data can be used to tell stories and express messages in an engaging way.

## Icebreaker
For the ice breaker, have each student fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/fFeYSmrVp61zgYiu6). At the end of the survey, they can click the "See previous responses" link to look at the cumulative data. Visualizations are automatically generated. It should be possible to view the results for the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgtmEYkNfC3nqGP8EhKnZz7tszR7qG_s3EZKNiuPHK8uByyA/viewanalytics).

Have the students introduce themselves and share which answers they gave, and then briefly look at the resulting charts.

## Lecture - PowerPoint
Present the [PowerPoint Presentation](DataVisualization.pptx). There are copious notes in the slides - make sure to keep it interactive and ask the students questions throughout.

## Formative Assessment - Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/625d949bde94f480c5f84db3). You must create a Blooket account in order to host the game. There are a few different options - not sure which one is the best.

## Follow-Along - College Data
Walk through the follow-along activity as a group. It contains two parts: students will start by creating charts in a Google Sheet, then move onto a Google Colab notebook. Students will need a Google account in order to participate. They will have to make a copy of the spreadsheet. For the notebook, they should just be able to go to the link and start editing as long as they have an account.

Credentials for any student without a Google account:

- Username: **techoutreachstudent@gmail.com**
- Password: **L3arningIsFun!**

>_Note: Do not make this public - it should only be reserved for students who do not have access to an account._

## Self-Paced Work - Further Exploration
There are a few options for individual work.

- Students can continue to work on the college dataset, either in Google Sheets or Google Colab
- Students can look at the [Self-Paced Work page](SelfPacedWork.md) to see some other data sets
- Students can view the "Additional Explorations" links on the [main page](StudentDesc.md)
