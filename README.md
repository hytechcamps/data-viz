# Bringing Data to Life with Visualization
In this camp, students will discover the importance of data visualization. They will explore an interesting data set and figure out how to translate it into a satisfying visual. The goal is to learn how data can be used to tell stories and express messages in an engaging way.

## Icebreaker
For the ice breaker, have each student fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/fFeYSmrVp61zgYiu6). At the end of the survey, they can click the "See previous responses" link to look at the cumulative data. Visualizations are automatically generated. It should be possible to view the results for the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgtmEYkNfC3nqGP8EhKnZz7tszR7qG_s3EZKNiuPHK8uByyA/viewanalytics).

Have the students introduce themselves and share which answers they gave, and then briefly look at the resulting charts.

## Lecture
Present the [PowerPoint Presentation](DataVisualization.pptx). There are copious notes in the slides - make sure to keep it interactive and ask the students questions throughout.

## Formative Assessment
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/625d949bde94f480c5f84db3). You must create a Blooket account in order to host the game. There are a few different options - not sure which one is the best.
