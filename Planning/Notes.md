# Bringing Data to Life with Visualization
In this camp, students will discover the importance of data visualization. They will explore an interesting data set and figure out how to translate it into a satisfying visual. The goal is to learn how data can be used to tell stories and express messages in an engaging way.

## Examples
- [The Bob Emergency: a study of athletes named Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvh6NLqKRfs&t=105s)
  - Created by Jon Bois using Google Earth
  - Play from starting point to ~3:30
  - Tells a story of the rise and fall of a name
- [Interactive Government Budget from 2016](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/interactive-budget)
  - From the Obama White House
  - Makes the relationship between budget categories much more tangible/digestible
- [US Interstate Map](https://interstate-map.com/#)
  - Mapping geographical data
  - Color-coordination and interactivity/filtering
- Covid - use visualizations to decide where resources should be allocated

## Ideas
- Comparing a spreadsheet to a graph
- Showing how the same dataset can tell different stories
  - duty to remain skeptical
  - examples of misleading visuals, axes starting at different points, purposefully leaving things out
  - Data Scientist in florida, asked to fudge covid numbers

## Outline
Parts of the camp

### Icebreaker
Maybe something data-driven?

have students go to https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1 and each talk about what they found

### Lecture
- Start with a hook/examples
  - hook idea - thing that you can toggle different things with world data - Allie will try to find
  - https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1
- Discuss the importance
- Maybe some of the history
- Recent history - internet generates a LOT of data, what do you do with it?
  - some number of bytes of data, volume has skyrocketed
  - can use visualization to see what you even have - really important in data analytics/data science - career building skill
- Touch on languages/libraries used
- basic graph types / different types of data (numerical, categorical)
- Joseph will come up with a draft for the lecture

### Formative Assessment
Kahoot covering the content of the lecture

### Follow-Along Activity
- Maybe a Google Sheets graph or something?
- Google Colab, Python, ggplot
- Find an interesting dataset
  - popular, well-known datasets
  - iris = data about flowers
  - mpg = data about cars
    - Allie's guide
  - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
  - Allie will look for more datasets
- Have some starter code
- Walk through the process of changing the visualization
    - ggplot has different themes available - change color/line width
- Joseph and Allie can collaborate on the follow-along - Joseph can start it

### Self-Paced Work
- Possibly have other datasets for students to explore?
  - choose your own adventure - maybe look on kaggle
  - Colab - should be able to add stuff in the working directory, data should persist
    - comment different ways to load data, instruct students to run cell
- Challenges with some guidance
